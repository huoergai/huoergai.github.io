## The Feynman Technique:The Best Way to learn Anything ##

**Two Types of Knowledge**

- The first type of knowledge focuses on knowing the name of something.
- The second focuses on knowing something.

> The person who says he knows what he thinks but cannot express it usually does not know what he thinks.----Mortimer Adler

There are four simple steps to the Feynman Technique, which I'll explain below:

1. Choose a Concept
2. Teach it to Toddler
3. Identify Gaps and Go Back to The Source Material
4. Review and Simplify(optional)

**Step 1:Teach it to a child**

Take out a blank sheet of paper write the subject you want to learn at the top. Write out what you about the subject as if you were teaching it to a child.

When you write out an idea from start to finish in simple language that a child can understand(use only the most common words), you force yourself to understand the concept at a deeper level and simplify relationships and connections between ideas. If you struggle, you have a clear understanding of where you have some gaps. That tension is good, It heralds an opportunity to learn.

**Step 2: Review**

In step one, you will inevitably encounter gaps in your knowledge where you're forgetting something important, are not able to explain it, or simply have trouble connecting an important concept.

This is invaluable feedback because you've discovered the edge of your knowledge. Competence is knowing the limit of your abilities, and you've just identified one!

This is where the learning starts. Now you know where you got stuck, go back to the source material and re-learn it until you can explain it in basic terms.

Identifying the boundaries of your understanding also limits the mistakes you're liable to make and increases your chance of success when applying knowledge.

**Step 3 Organize and Simplify**

Now you have a set of hand-crafted notes. Review them to make sure you didn't mistakenly borrow any of the jargon from the source material. Organize them into a simple story that flows.

Read them out loud. If the explanation isn't simple or sounds confusing that's a good indication 

that your understanding in that area still needs some work.

**Step 4 (optional) : Transmit**

If you really want to be sure of your understanding, run it past someone. The ultimate test of your knowledge is your capacity to convey it to another.

> Not only is this a wonderful recipe for learning but it's also a window into a different way of thinking that allows you to tear ideas apart and reconstruct them from ground up. This leads to a much deeper understanding of the ideas and concepts. Importantly, approaching problems in this way allow you to understand when others don't know what they are talking about.

## The Benjamin Franklin Method of Reading Programming Books

**Here's how it works:**

1. Read programming book as normal. When get to a code sample, read it over.
2. close the book.
3. try to type it up.

Try it and watch as you're forced to learn some of the structure of the code.

It's a lot like the way you may have already been doing it, just with more learning.
