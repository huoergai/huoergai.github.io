# Learning how to learn

## Week-1

### Focused versus Diffuse Thinking

#### Introduction to the Focused and Diffuse Modes

Researchers have found that we have two fundamentally different modes of thinking. The Focused and the Diffuse modes. 

As far as neuroscientists know, we’re either in the focused mode or the diffuse mode of thinking. It seems we can’t be in both thinking modes at the same time.

Choose from these two modes base on the situation.

#### Introduction to the Course Structure



#### Welcome and Course Information

#### Using the Focused and Diffuse mode--Or, a Little Dali will do you

- Analogies provide powerful techniques for learning
- Focused and diffuse mode each helps us lean in very different ways
- Learning something difficult can take time, the brain needs to alternate its way of learning as it grapples with and assimilates the new material.

#### What is Learning?

- The brain consumes ten times more energy by weight than the rest of the body
- Brain connectivity is dynamic and remain so even if it matures

## Week-2

### Chunking--The Essentials

#### Introduction to Chunking

- What is a chunk
- How to form a chunk
- How it help us in our studies 
- Illusions of competence in learning
- Talking about overlearning

#### What is a Chunk?

- Chunking is the mental leap that helps unite bits of information together through meaning.
- Chunks are pieces of information, through bound together through meaning or use.

#### How to form a Chunk - Part 1

> A little background about how to make a chunk.

- Getting an initial sense of the pattern you want to master for yourself is similar for most subjects or skills.
- The best chunks are the ones that are so well ingrained, that you don't even have to consciously think about connecting the neural pattern together, That, actually, is the point of making a complex ideas, movements or reactions into a single chunk.
- It can be too easy to focus too much on why an individual step works and not on the connection between steps.

#### The How to Form a Chunk - Part 2

1. Focus attention on the information
2. Understand the basic idea
3. Gain context

#### Illusions of Competence

### Seeing the Bigger Picture

#### What Motivates You?

**Neuromodulators:** Chemicals that influence how a neurons response to other neurons. Here are three of them.

- Acetylcholine   乙酰胆碱
- Dopamine         多巴胺
- Serotonin           五羟色胺

##### Acetylcholine

1. Acetylcholine neurons form neuromodulator connections to the cortex that are particularly important for focused learning, which requires close attention.
2. Project widely and activate circuits that control synaptic plasticity.
3. Leading to new long term memory.
4. Neuromodulators have a profound impact on unconscious mind.

##### Dopamine

1. Control motivation
2. Part of a large brain system that control reward learning.
3. When receive an unexpected reward, the dopamine neurons release dopamine.
4. Dopamine signals project widely and have a powerful effect on learning.
5. affect decision-making, and even the value of sensory inputs.
6. Dopamine is in the business of predicting future rewards and not just the immediate reward. 
7. Loss of Dopamine neurons leads to a lack of motivation and anhedonia.
8. Severe loss of Dopamine neurons causes Parkinson's disease.

##### Serotonin

1. Serotonin is a third diffuse neuromodulator system that strongly affects social life
2. The level of Serotonin is closely linked to risk taking behavior. With higher risk in lower Serotonin level.

#### The Value of a Library Chunks

1. The ability to combine chunks in new and original ways underlies a lot of historical innovation.

2. Basically to enhance knowledge and gain expertise is to gradually build the number of chunks in mind. 

3. The bigger and more well practiced the chunked mental library, the more easily to solve problems and figure out solutions.

4. Transfer: Chunks can also help understand new  concepts.

5. A chunk is a way of compressing information much more compactly. The more experience you gain in chunking in particular subject, The bigger the chunk you’re able to create.

6. Diffuse mode can help to connect two or more chunks together in new ways to solve novel problems.

7. Two ways to figure something out or to solve problems: 

   - Sequential thinking: Each small step leads deliberately towards a solution, involves the focused mode.
   - Intuition: Often require creative diffuse mode linking of several seemingly different focused mode thoughts.

   Most difficult problems and concepts are grasped through intuition, because these new ideas make a leap away from what we familiar with.

   Diffuse mode’s semi-random way of making connections means that the solutions they provide should be carefully verified using the focused mode.

8. Lady luck favors the one who tries.

#### Overlearning, Choking, Einstellung, and Interleaving

##### Overlearning 

Continuing to studying or practice after you’ve mastered what you can is called overlearning.

- Overlearning can produce an automatically,  

- Focusing on more difficult material is call deliberate practice.

##### Einstellung

Initial simple thought, ideas already in mind or neural patterns already developed and strengthened, prevent a better idea or solution from being found.

##### Interleaving

Jumping back and forth between problems or situations that require different techniques or strategies.

- It’s interleaving that starts building flexibility and creativity.

  

## Week-3

### Procrastination

#### Introduction to Procrastination and Memory

- two different ideas: procrastination and memory

- more information about how procrastination happens
- simple ways to tackle procrastination
- the best ways to access brain’s most powerful long-term memory systems.

#### Tackling Procrastination: It’s easier and more valuable than you think

- Inner zombies - the routine, habitual responses brain falls into as a result of specific cues. These zombie responses are often focused on making the here and now better.
- Not all procrastination is bad. Good learning is a bit by bit activity, It’s better to put the same amount of time into learning but spacing that learning out by starting earlier. First things first.
- Unlike procrastination which is easy to fall into, willpower is hard to come by.
- Procrastination can be a single monumentally important keystone bad habit, a habit that influences many important areas of our life.
- Procrastination shares features with addiction. It offers temporary excitement and relief from sometimes boring reality.
- The higher you go in your studies the more important it is to take control of procrastination.
- Procrastinations put off just one little thing, They do it again and again gradually growing used to it.

#### Zombies Everywhere

- Neuro-scientifically speaking, chunking is related to habit. Habit is an energy saver. It allows us to free our mind for other types of activities.

- Four parts of habits:

  1. The first is cue. This is the trigger that launches you into zombie mode.

  2. Number two - the routine. This is the zombie mode. 

  3. Number three - the reward. Every habit develops and continues because it rewards us. It give us an immediate little feeling of pleasure.

  4. Number four - the belief. Habits have power because you believe in them.

#### Surf’s Up: Process Versus Product

**One of the best way of being effective in learning is to use mental tools and tricks to inspire and motivate yourself.**

- Focus on process not product.
  1. It’s perfectly normal to start with a few negative feelings about beginning a learning session. It’s how we handle those feelings that matters.
  2. Put negative thinking aside, quit wasting time and just get on with it, once you get going, you’ll feel better about it.
- Process means, the flow of time and the habits and actions associated with that flow of time.
  1. Product is an outcome.
  2. To prevent procrastination you want to avoid concentrating on assignment that you need to finish. instead, you attention should be on building processes.
  3. Processes relate to simple habit, habits that coincidentally allow you to do the unpleasant task that need to be done.
  4. The product is what triggers the pain that causes you to procrastinate.
- One of the easiest way to focus on process is to focus on doing a Pomodoro, not on completing a task.
  1. The essential idea is that the zombie habitual part of your brain likes processes because it can march mindlessly along.

#### Harnessing Your Zombies to Help You

> The trick to overriding a habit is to look to change reaction to a cue. The only place need to apply willpower is to change reaction to the cue.

**Four components of habit:**

- The first one is the cue. Recognize what launches you into your zombie procrastination mode. Cues usually fall into one of the four following categories.
  1. Location
  2. Time
  3. How you feel, and 
  4. Reactions either to other people or to something that just happened
- Number two - the routine. 
  1. The key to re-wiring habit is to have a plan. Developing a new ritual can be helpful.
- Number three is the reward.  This can sometimes require a little bit of investigation.
  1. Habits are powerful because they create neurological cravings.
  2. Only once your brain starts expecting that reward will the important rewiring take place that will allow you to create new habits.
  3. Setting a reward at a specific time can help spur work.
  4. The better you get at something, the more enjoyable it can become.
- Number four is the belief. 
  1. The most important part of changing procrastination habit is the belief that we can do it.
  2. Belief that new system works is what can get us through.
  3. Part of what can underpin is to develop a new community.
  4. Developing and encouraging culture with like-minded friends can help us remember the values that in moments of weakness we tend to forget.

#### Juggling Life and Learning

- A good way to keep perspective about what we’re trying to learn and accomplish, is to once a week write a brief weekly list of key task in a planner journal.

  1. Then each day on another page of the planner journal, write a list of the tasks that we can reasonable work on or accomplish.

  2. Write the daily task list the evening before. Research has shown that this helps our subconscious to grapple with the tasks on list so we can figure out how to accomplish them.

- Mixing other tasks up with learning seems to make everything more enjoyable and keeps us from prolonged and unhealthy bouts of sitting.

  1. The more experience you gain, the better you get at gauging how long it takes to do any given task. 

  2. You’ll find yourself improving quickly as you become more realistic about what you can reasonably do in any given time.

  3. Make notes in planner journal about what works and what doesn’t. 

  4. Planning your quitting time is as important as planning your working time.

- Those who are committed to maintaining healthy leisure time along with their hard work, outperform those who doggedly pursue an endless treadmill.

  1. Eat frogs first in the morning. Try to work on a most important and most dislike task first.
  2. Lady luck favors the one who tries.
  3. Planning well is part of trying, Keep eyes on learning goal, and try not to get too unsettled by occasional roadblocks.

#### Summing Up Procrastination

Learning well often involves bit by bit, day by day building of solid neural scaffolds. This is why tackling procrastination is so incredibly important.

Here is an overview of the key aspects of tackling procrastination.

- Keep a planner journal so you can easily track when you reach your goals and observe what does and doesn’t work.
- Commit yourself to certain routines and tasks each day.
- Write your planned tasks out the night before so your brain has tie to dwell on your goals and help ensure success. 
- Arrange your work into series of small challenges.
- Always make sure you, and your zombies, get lots of rewards.
- Take a few minutes to savor the feelings of happiness and triumph, which also gives your brain a chance to temporarily change modes.
- Deliberately delay rewards until you’ve finished a task.
- Watch for procrastination cues. Try putting yourself in new  surroundings with few procrastination cues, such as the quiet section of a library.
- Gain trust in your new system. You want to work hard during times of focused concentration and also to trust your system enough so that when it comes time to relax, you actually relax without feelings of guilt or worry.
- Have back up plans for when you still procrastinate. No one’s perfect after all.
- Eat your frogs first every day. Happy experimenting.

### Memory

#### Diving Deeper into Memory

- Part of the reason an image is so important to memory is that images connect directly to right brain’s visual spatial centers.
  1. The image helps encapsulate a seemingly humdrum and hard to remember concept by tapping into visual areas with enhanced memory abilities.
  2. The more neural hooks can build by evoking the senses, the easier it will be  to recall the concept and what it means.
- Focusing attention brings something into temporary working memory, but for that something to move from working memory to long term memory two things should happen: 
  1. The idea should be memorable.
  2. It must be repeated.
- Remember to repeat not a bunch of times in one day but sporadically over several days.
- Index cards can often be helpful. Writing and saying what you’re trying to learn seems to enhance retention.
- The more we turn what we’re trying to remember into something memorable, the easier it will be to recall.

#### What is Long Term Memory?

- There are multiple memory systems for different types of learning.
- The hippocampus is important part of a brain system for learning and memory of facts and events.
- Memories are not fixed but living.
- Consolidation takes the brain state in active memory and stores it in long term memory by modifying synapses on the dendrites of neurons.
- The long term memories can remain dormant for a long time until the memory is retrieved and reinstated in short term working memory.
- The reinstated memory is in a new context, which can itself be transferred to long term memory, thereby, altering the old memory through reconsolidation.
- Our memories are intertwined with each other. As we learn new things, our old memories also change.
- It is more effective to space learning over time, rather than mass learning all at once.
- Brains have several types of supporting cells called glial cells. The astrocyte is the most abundant glial cell in the human brain.
- Astrocytes provide nutrients to neurons, maintain extra cellular ion balance, and are involved with repair following injury.
- The Astrocytes may also have an important role in learning.

#### Creating Meaningful Groups and the Memory Palace Technique

- Another key to memorization is to create meaningful groups that simplify the material.
- It’s much easier to remember numbers by associating them with memorable events.
- The memory palace technique is a particularly powerful way of grouping things you want to remember.
- The memory palace technique is useful for remembering unrelated items.
- Memory tricks allow people to expand their working memory with easy access to long term memory. The memory process itself also becomes an exercise in creativity.
- The more you memorized using these innovative techniques, the more creative you become.

#### Summing Up Memory

- Two main memory systems involved in ability to chunk concepts.

  The first is long term memory, which is like a storage warehouse. We need to practice and repeat in order to help store items in long term memory so we can retrieve them more easily. Practicing and repeating should be extend to serval days, Tackling procrastination is important, it helps build better memories because we start earlier.

  The second, is working memory, which is like a poor blackboard that quickly fades. we can only hold about four items in our working memory. When we master a technique or concept in some sense, it compacts the ideas so they can occupy less space in our working memory when we do bring them to mind. This free our mental thinking space so that it can more easily grapple with other ideas.

- We have outstanding visual and spatial memory systems. 

- Another key to memorization is to create meaningful groups that simplify the material. 

## Week-4

### Renaissance Learning and Unlocking your Potential Ⅰ

#### How to Become a Better Learner

Two tips for how to learn better:

- Tip number one - the best gift that you can give your brain is Physical Exercise.

  In a few places, new  neurons are born every day. one of these places is in our Hippocampus, a brain area that is very important for learning new things.

  Exercise, interestingly also helps new neurons survive. Exercise is by far, more effective than any drug on the market today to help learn better.

  Exercise benefits all of our vital organisms, not just brain.

- Another tip - and this has to do with practice making perfect, but only when your brain is prepared.

  There are certain critical periods in the development of brain. 

  The critical period for first language acquisition extends up to puberty. 

  One of the best studied critical period in the brain is when binocular depth perception or stereopsis matures during the first two years of life.

- Practice can repair, as well as train the brain. But this takes much longer, past the critical period.

  The prefrontal cortex, which is the part that makes plans, is also involved in complex analysis in social behaviors, as well as decision making and planning.

#### Introduction to Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential

- It takes time to assimilate new knowledge.
- It’s inevitably go through some periods when we seem to take and exasperating step backwards. This is a natural phenomenon, that means that the brain is wresting deeply with the material. You’ll find your knowledge base will take a surprising leap forward, when you emerge from these periods of temporary frustration.

#### Create a Lively Visual Metaphor or Analogy

- One of the best things you can do to not only remember, but understand concepts, is to create a metaphor or analogy for them. The more visual the better.
- A metaphor is just a way of realizing that one thing is somehow similar to another.
- Metaphors and visualization, being able to something in your mind’s eye, have been especially helpful not only in art and literature, but also in allowing the scientific and engineering world to make progress.
- It’s often helpful to pretend that you are the concept you’re trying to understand.
- Metaphors and models are often vitally important in giving a physical understanding of the central idea behind the process or concept you are trying to understand.
- Metaphors and analogies are useful for getting people out of Einstellung, that is, being blocked  by thinking about a problem in the wrong way.
- Metaphors also help glue an idea into mind because they make a connection to neural structures that are already there.

#### No Need for Genius Envy

- There is an interesting connection between learning math and science and learning a sport.
- People learn by trying to make sense out of the information they perceive.
- The idea you are already holding in mind can block you from fresh thoughts.
- Having a somewhat smaller working memory means you can more easily generalize your learning into new, more creative combinations.
- It is practice, particularly deliberate practice on the toughest aspects of the material that can help lift average brains  into the realm of those with more natural gifts.
- The Imposter Syndrome.

#### Change Your thoughts, Change Your Life

- Practice appears to strengthen and reinforce connections between brain regions, creating highways between the brain’s control centers and the centers that store knowledge.
- It seems people can enhance the development of their neuronal circuits by practicing thoughts that use those neurons.
- We can make significant changes in our brain by changing how we think.
- Approaching material with a goal of learning it on your own, can give a unique path to mastery.
- Taking responsibility of you own learning is one of the most important things you can do.

### Renaissance Learning and Unlocking your Potential Ⅱ

#### The Value of Teamwork

- The right hemisphere helps us step back and put our work into big picture   perspective.
- The right hemisphere is vitally important in getting into the right track and doing reality checks.
- Even subtle avoidance of some of our capabilities can have a surprisingly negative impact on our work.
- The right hemisphere serves as a sort of devil’s advocate to question the status quo and look for global inconsistencies.
- The left hemisphere tries to cling tenaciously to the way things were.
- The left hemisphere interprets the world for us and will go to great lengths to keep those interpretations unchanging.
- When you work in the focus mode, it’s easy to make minor mistakes in your assumptions or calculations.
- The more left centered focus mode has associated with it a desire to cling to what you’ve done.
- The first principle is that you must not fool yourself. And you are the easiest person to fool.
- One of the best ways to catch you blind spots and errors is to brainstorm and work with others who are also smartly focused on the topic.
- Friends and teammates can serve as sort of ever questioning larger scale diffuse mode outside your brain that can catch what you missed, or what you just can’t see.
- Explaining to friends helps building our own understanding.
- The importance of working with others doesn’t just relate to learning. It’s also important in career building. 

#### A Test Checklist

A checklist we can use to see whether our preparation for test taking is on target.

- Did you make a serious effort to understand the text? Just hunting for relevant worked-out examples doesn’t count.
- Did you work with classmates on homework problems or at least check your solutions with others.
- Did you attempt to outline every homework problem solution before working with classmates?
- Did you participate actively in homework group discussions contributing ideas and asking questions?
- Did you consult with the instructor or teaching assistants when you were having trouble with something?
- Did you understand all your homework problem solutions when they were handed in?
- Did you ask in class for explanations of homework problem solutions that weren’t clear to you?
- If you have a study guide, did you carefully go through it before the test and convince yourself you could do everything on it?
- Did you attempt to outline lots of problem solutions quickly without spending time on the Algebra in Calculating?
- Did you go over the study guide and problems with classmates and quiz one other? 
- If there was review before the test, did you attended and asked questions about anything you weren’t sure about?
- And lastly, did you get a reasonable night’s sleep before the test? If your answer is no, your answers to all the preceding questions my not matter.

#### Hard Start - Jump to Easy

- Tough problems often need lots of time, meaning you’d want to start on them first thing on the test.
- Difficult problems can also scream for the creative powers of the diffuse mode.
- To access the diffuse mode, you need to not be focusing on what you so badly want to solve.
- The answer is to start with the hard problems but quickly jump to the easy ones.
- Starting hard loads the first most difficult problem in mind and then switches attention away from it. Both these activities are what allow the diffuse mode to begin its work.
- Using the hard start jump to easy technique on tests guarantees that you will have at least a little work done on every problem. It’s also a valuable technique for helping you avoid Einstellung, getting stuck on the wrong approach - because you have a chance to look at the problem from differing perspectives.
- The only trick with this approach is that you must have the self-discipline to pull yourself off a problem once you find yourself stuck for a minute or two.

#### Final Helpful Hints for Tests

- The body puts out chemicals such as cortisol when it’s under stress. This can cause sweaty palms, a racing heart, a knot on the pit of your stomach.
- Research finds it’s how you interpret these symptoms. The story  you tell yourself about why you’re stressed makes all the difference.
- If you shift your thinking from, this test has made me afraid, to this test has got me excited to do my best. It can really improve your performance.
- Another good tip for panicky test taker is to momentarily turn your attention to your breathing.
- Once you have a plan for the worst possible contingency, you’ll be surprised that the fear will begin to subside.
- Good worry helps provide motivation and focus, while bad worry simply wastes energy.

#### Summary for Module 4

- Metaphors and analogies aren’t just for art and literature. One of the best things you can do to not only remember, but more easily understand concepts in many different fields, is to create a metaphor or analogy form them. Often, the more visual, the better.
- If you change your thoughts, you can really, truly change your life. It seems people can enhance the development of their circuit by practicing thoughts that use those neurons.
- When you whiz through a homework or test question and you don’t go back to check your work, you’re acting a little like a person who is refusing to use part of your brain. You’re not stopping to take a mental breath and then revisit what you’ve done with the bigger picture in mind, to see whether it makes sense.
- Overconfidence in your results can result from using only one mode of thinking. By making it a point to do some of your studying with friends, you can more easily catch where your thinking has gone astray.
- Counterintuitive strategies such as the hard start jump to easy technique, can give your brain a chance to reflect on harder challenges even as you’re focusing on other more straightforward problems.

**Some last test taking pointers:**

- The body puts out chemicals when it’s under stress. How you interpret your body’s reaction to those chemicals makes all the difference. If you shift your thinking from, this test has made me afraid, to this test has got me excited to do my best, it helps improve your performance.
- Your mind can trick you into thinking that what you’ve done is correct even if it isn’t. This mean that whenever possible you should blink, shift your attention, and then double check your answers, using a big picture perspective, asking yourself, does this really make sense?
- Not getting enough sleep the night before a test can negate any other preparation you’ve done.

#### Wrap up to the Course by Terence Sejnowski and Barbara Oakley 

- You have not truly learned something unless you can tech it to others.
- Passions can broaden, change, and grow.
