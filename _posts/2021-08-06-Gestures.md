Compose provides a variety of APIs to help you detect gestures that are generated from user interactions. The APIs cover a wide range of use cases:

- Some of them are **high-level** and designed to cover the most commonly used gestures. like the clickable modifier allows easy detection of a click, and it also provides accessibility features and display visual indicators when tapped.
- There are also less commonly used gestured detectors that offer more flexibility on a **lower level**. like PointerInputScope.detectTapGestures or PointerInputScope.detectDragGestures but didn't include the extra features.

## Tapping and pressing

The **clickable** modifier allows apps to detect **clicks** on the element it's applied to.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ClickableSample() {
  val count = remember { mutableStateOf(0) }
  Text(
    text = count.value.toString(),
    modifier.Modifier.clickable { count.value += 1 }
  )
}
```

when more flexibility is needed, you can provide a tap gesture detector via the **pointerInput** modifier.

```kotlin
Modifier.pointerInput(Unit) {
  detectTagGestures(
    onPress = { /* Called when the gesture starts */ },
    onDoubleTap = { /* Called on Double Tap */ },
    onLongPress = { /* Called on Long Press */ },
    onTap = { /* Called on Tap */ }
  )
}
```

## Scrolling

**Note:** If you want to show a list of items, consider using **LazyColumn** and **LazyRow** instead of these APIs. **LazyColumn** and **LazyRow** feature scrolling, and they are much more efficient than the scrolling modifier because they only compose the items as they're needed

### Scroll modifiers

The **verticalScroll** and **horizontalScroll** modifiers provide the simplest way to allow the user to scroll an element when the bounds of its contents are larger than its maximum constraints.

The **ScrollState** allows you to change the scroll position or get its current state. To create it with default parameters, use **rememberScrollState()**.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ScrollBoxesSmooth() {
  // Smoothly scroll 100px on first composition
  val state = rememberScrollState()
  LaunchedEffect(Unit) { state.animateScrollTo(100) }
  
  Column(
    modifier = Modifier
      .backgraound(Color.LightGray)
      .size(100.dp)
      .padding(horizontal = 8.dp)
      .verticalScroll(state)
  ) {
    repeat(10) {
      Text("Item $it", modifier = Modifier.padding(2.dp))
    }
  }
}
```

### Scrollable modifier

The **scrollable** modifier differs from the scroll modifiers in that **scrollable** detects the gestures, but does not offset its conents.

A **ScrollableController** is required for this modifier to work correctly. When constructing **ScrollableController**  you must provide a **consumeScrollDelta** function which will be invoked on each scroll step (by gesture input, smooth scrolling or flinging) with the delta in pixels.

The amount of scrolling distance consumed must be returned from this function to ensure proper event propagation.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ScrollableSample() {
  // actual composable state
  var offset by remember { mutableStateOf(0f) }
  Box(
    Modifier
      .size(150.dp)
      .scrollable(
        orientation = Orientation.Vertical,
        // Scrollable state: describe how to consume scrolling delta and update offset
        state = rememberScrollableState { delta ->
          offset += delta
          delta
        }
      )
      .background(Color.LightGray),
    contentAlignment = Alignment.Center
  ) {
    Text(offset.toString())
  }
}
```

### Nested Scrolling

Compose supports nested scrolling, in which multiple elements react to a single scroll gesture.

**Automatic nested scrolling**

Simple nested scrolling requires no action on your part. Gestures that initiate a scrolling action are propagated from children to parents automatically, such that when the child can't scroll any further, the gesture is handled by its parent element.

```kotlin
val gradient = Brush.verticalGradient(0f to Color.Gray, 1000f to Color.White)
Box(
  modifier = Modifier
    .background(Color.LightGray)
    .verticalScroll(rememberScrollState())
    .padding(32.dp)
) {
  Column {
    repeat(6) {
      Box(
        modifier = Modifier
          .height(128.dp)
          .verticalScroll(rememberScrollState())
      ) {
        Text(
          "Scroll here",
          modifier = Modifier
            .border(12.dp, Color.DarkGray)
            .background(brush = gradient)
            .padding(24.dp)
            .height(150.dp)
        )
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Using the nestedScroll modifier**

If you need to create an advanced coordinated scroll between multiple elements, the **nestedScroll** modifier gives  you more flexibility by defining a nested scrolling hierarchy.

## Dragging

The **draggable** modifier is the high-level entry point to drag gestures in a single orientation, and reports the drag distance in pixels.

It's important to note that this modifier is similar to **scrollable**, in that it only detects the gesture. You need to hold the state and represent it on screen by, for example, moving the element via the **offset** modifier.

```kotlin
val offsetX by remember { mutableStateOf(0f) }
Text(
  modifier = Modifier
    .offset { IntOffset(offsetX.roundToInt(), 0) }
    .draggable(
      orientation = Orientation.Horizontal,
      state = rememberDraggableState { delta ->
        offsetX += delta
      }
    ),
  text = "Drag me!"
)
```

If you need to control the whole dragging gesture, consider using the drag gesture detector instead, via the **pointerInput** modifer.

```kotlin
Box(modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize()) {
  val offsetX by = remember { mutableStateOf(0f) }
  val offsetY by = remember { mutableStateOf(of) }
  
  Box(
    Modifier
      .offset { IntOffset(offsetX.roundToInt(),offsetY.roundToInt()) }
      .background(Color.Blue)
      .size(50.dp)
      .pointerInput(Unit) {
        detectDragGestures { change, dragAmount ->
          change.consumeAllChanges()
          offsetX += dragAmount.x
          offsetY += dragAmount.y
        }
      }
  )
}
```



## Swiping

The **swipeable** modifier lets you drag elements which, when released, animate towards typically two or more anchor points defined in an orientation. A common usage for this is to implement a 'swipe-to-dismiss' pattern.

This modifier does not move the element, it only detects the gesture. You need to hold the state and represent it on screen by, for example,  moving the element via the **offset** modifier.

The swipeable stateis required in the **swipeable** modifier, and can be created and remembered with **rememberSwipeableState()**. This state also provides a set of useful methods to programmatically animate to anchors ( see **snapTo, animateTo, performFling**, and **performDrag** ) as well as properties to observe the dragging progress. 

The swipe gesture can be configured to have different threshold types, such as **FixedThreshold(Dp)** amd **FractionalThreshold(Float)**, and they can be different for each anchor point from-to combination.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun SwipeableSample() {
  val width = 96.dp
  val squareSize = 48.dp
  
  val swipeableState = rememberSwipeableState(0)
  val sizePx = with(LocalDensity.current) { squareSize.toPx() }
  val anchors = mapOf(0f to 0, sizePx to 1) // Maps anchor points (in px) to states
  
  Box(
    modifier = Modifier
      .width(width)
      .swipeable(
        state = swipeableState,
        anchors = anchors,
        thresholds = { _,_-> FractionalThreshold(0.3f) },
        orientation = Orientation.Horizontal
      )
      .background(Color.LightGray)
  ) {
    Box(
      Modifier
        .offset { IntOffset(swipeableState.offset.value.roundToInt(), 0) }
        .size(squareSize)
        .background(Color.DarkGray)
    )
  }
}
```

## Multitouch: Panning, zooming, rotating

To detect multitouch gesture used for panning, zooming and rotating, you can use the **transformable** modifier. This modifier does not transform elements by itself, it only detects the gestures.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun TransformableSample() {
  // set up all transformation states
  val scale by remember { mutableStateOf(1f) }
  val rotate by remember { mutableStateOf(0f) }
  val offset by remember { mutableStateOf(Offset.Zero) }
  val state = rememberTransformableState { zoomChange, offsetChange, roatateChange ->
    scale *= zoomChange
    rotation += rotationChange
    offset += offsetChange
  }
  Box(
    Modifier
      // apply other transformations like rotation and zoom on the pizza slice emoji
      .graphicsLayer(
        scaleX = scale,
        scaleY = scale,
        rotationZ = raotation,
        translationX = offset.x,
        translationY = offset.y
      )
      // add transformable to listen to multitouch transformation events after offset
      .transformable(state = state)
      .background(Color.Blue)
      .fillMaxSize()
  )
}
```

If you need to combine zooming, panning and rotation with other gesture, you can use the **PointerInputScope.detectTransformGestures** detector.
